The official documentation for the **Decision Tree Classifier** in Scikit-learn offers a comprehensive explanation of how decision trees are implemented for classification tasks. It covers model parameters, training procedures, and how to make predictions using a decision tree. This resource is essential for learning the fundamentals of decision tree models and their usage in Python.

The **Random Forest Classifier** documentation provides a detailed guide on implementing a random forest model, an ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy. This resource includes explanations on how to configure the model, tune hyperparameters, and interpret the results. Random forests are widely used for their robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.

The **ISLR (Introduction to Statistical Learning) Chapter 8** videos cover essential tree-based methods such as decision trees and random forests. These videos provide both theoretical insights and practical examples, making them a great resource for learning how tree-based models work in real-world scenarios. The first five videos in the series cover the core concepts and techniques you need to know.
