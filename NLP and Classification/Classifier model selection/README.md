# Classifier Model Selection

This reference document serves as a guide to reinforce my understanding of the **Classifier Model Selection** lesson, which I have covered.

## Resources

### 1. Visual Comparison of Classifiers
- [Scikit-learn Documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html)
- Learn how to visually compare different classifiers using **Scikit-learn** in Python.
- Example implementation of classifier visualization techniques.

### 2. Scikit-learn Guide on Model Evaluation
- [Scikit-learn Model Evaluation Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)
- A comprehensive guide on **evaluating classification models** using Scikit-learn.
- Includes step-by-step instructions and code snippets for effective model assessment.

### 3. Improving Model Performance using Cross-Validation
- A tutorial on enhancing **model performance** through cross-validation in Python and R.
- [Cross-validation Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)
- [Cross-validation Tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/improve-model-performance-cross-validation-in-python-r/)
- Covers different cross-validation techniques such as **k-fold, stratified k-fold, and leave-one-out cross-validation**.
