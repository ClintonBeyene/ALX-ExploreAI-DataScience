# Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters. It provides a tree-like visual representation of observations, called a dendrogram. Instead of pre-defining the number of clusters, hierarchical clustering allows us to determine cluster groupings based on the dendrogram structure.

## Additional Resources
Here are some useful resources I covered while studying hierarchical clustering:

1. **Hierarchical Clustering [ISLR]**  
   - In this resource, hierarchical clustering is explained in detail, focusing on the concept of a dendrogram to represent the hierarchy of clusters.

2. **StatQuest Video on Hierarchical Clustering**  
   - A clear and concise explanation of hierarchical clustering, covering key concepts with easy-to-understand visuals.

3. **365DataScience Tutorial on Clustering**  
   - This tutorial introduces the two major types of clustering: flat and hierarchical. It also provides an in-depth explanation of dendrograms.
