# **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Resources**  

This README is a collection of resources from my study to understand Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It includes high-quality references for learning and applying PCA in data science and machine learning. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced practitioner, these materials will help you visualize, implement, and interpret PCA effectively.
